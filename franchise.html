			  <h3>Business Opportunity</h3><br>
			  <p>STEM Learning and Robotics today are the buzz word in education industry. Parents and Schools have woken to the fact of teaching students using “Activity Based Learning” approach. NEBOT helps students to assimilate the concepts of Science and Mathematics. STEM and Robotics Learning helps students to design and create their own simple machines.</p>			  
			  <br>
			  <h3>What is the STEM and Robotics Training Business Opportunity?</h3><br>
			  <p>Every parent and school today has become exam oriented. Everyone is craving to achieve more marks in their exams right from the beginning of the child’s academics in school. We have lost focus on building the fundamental skills of the child as per his/her creativity inclination. Most of the parents, today, want their child to become engineer, doctor or such other professional in their future life. Unfortunately, till now we did not have any activity or program to strengthen their knowledge in these areas while in school academics. The focus is more on getting good marks.
On the other hand, if the parent identifies or wants their child to gain knowledge in music, dance, arts or karate they enroll them in these classes with intent of developing these traits. Similarly, Engineering, Medical, Designing, etc. are skills. These skills, if harnessed from childhood, would turn your child in the best amongst the professionals in the field of their choice. For harnessing these skills, parents are now looking at robotics as the most potential activity since it allows the child to innovate and create models of their own choice. Once the child is involved in creation of these models, the knowledge earned is tremendous. Thinking process gets initiated and brilliant ideas start flashing in the child’s mind for finding solutions to the problems around. If guided properly, the child might come out with excellent fresh ideas to solve the current issues. This is how child prodigies get created. Robotics and STEM business opportunity presents an innovative way of doing business while creating child prodigies. Here we harness the child’s creativity and innovative ability and teach them Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in fun manner. Most of the high paying careers are available in the STEM domain. Entering into STEM isn’t just a great way to get a good job. It’s also a way to get a high paying job. Studies and surveys have shown that 63% of people with a degree in STEM related work get paid more than someone with a bachelor’s degree in anything else. More than that, 47% of people with a bachelor’s degree in a STEM field make more than people with a Ph.D. in other areas. Basically, you’ll be more likely to make lots of money than someone who majors in another field of study.
Hence, to create great engineers, NEBOT Robotics programs help school going students to understand STEM in a friendly manner we remove the fear of science and mathematics from their minds. Instead we teach them to play and experiment with science and mathematics.

Huge business opportunity exists in this arena since here we focus of fundamental development of the child in STEM areas with the help of Robotics.
